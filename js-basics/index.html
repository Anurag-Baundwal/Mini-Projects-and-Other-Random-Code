<!--
    NOTE:
    There are two places where we can insert the script element. 
        We can place it the head or in the body, but the best practice is to 
        place it just before the end of the body. There are two reasons for that:
        
        1.  The browser parses the file from top to bottom. If we place our js in the 
            head, the browser can get stuck parsing the js, and this would delay the rendering
            of the page. In other words, it would make the page slow.
            
        2.  Almost always, the code in those tags needs to talk to the elements
            in the body. So the elements need to be properly rendered first.
